# QueryBridge

QueryBridge is a lightweight Flask application for harvesting Databricks schema metadata through SQL-only access and turning that metadata into a local graphical SQL query builder.

## Initial workflow

1. QueryBridge shows the SQL to run in Databricks.
2. Copy the result grid from Databricks and paste it into QueryBridge.
3. QueryBridge stores the metadata in local SQLite.
4. It generates the next metadata query for each discovered table.
5. Paste each result back into the matching table record.
6. The Query Builder uses the captured tables, fields and inferred relationships to generate SQL.

## Databricks metadata queries

Start with:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

For each table QueryBridge generates:

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED schema_name.table_name AS JSON;
```

The JSON form requires Databricks Runtime / SQL support for `DESCRIBE TABLE ... AS JSON`. QueryBridge also accepts the older human-readable `DESCRIBE TABLE` result as a fallback.

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5086

## Storage

Local metadata is stored in `instance/querybridge.db`. No Databricks credentials are required because metadata is transferred manually by copy/paste.
